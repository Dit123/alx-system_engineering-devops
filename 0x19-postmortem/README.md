 Postmortem Report
Incident Summary
On October 10, 2023, a critical system failure occurred from 8:00 AM WAT to 6:00 PM WAT, significantly impacting our services. This incident affected 45% of our users, resulting in data loss and restricted access to our platform. The primary cause of the issue was a weak backup procedure.

Impact
The incident resulted in data loss and restricted user access during the specified timeframe.

Root Cause
The initial indication of the problem was a monitoring alert that suggested a planned backup system failure. Further investigation revealed that a backup scheduling script had been improperly configured, causing data loss due to an improper backup initiation.

Investigations
The investigation commenced at 8:30 AM WAT. Suspecting a hardware problem, the initial focus was on storage systems and network logs. Senior database administrators and infrastructure leaders quickly escalated the issue due to its urgency.

Resolution
The issue was resolved at 5:30 PM WAT. A quick resolution was achieved by modifying the script's time zone settings and initiating a manual backup process, which systematically restored all corrupted data.

Lessons Learned
Regular Testing: Routine testing and validation of backup procedures are crucial to identifying configuration issues before they lead to incidents.

Monitoring Enhancements: Continuous monitoring and alerting systems should be fine-tuned to ensure early detection of potential problems.

Documentation: Detailed documentation of system configurations and scripts can expedite the resolution process.
